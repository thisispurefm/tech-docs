# Welcome to the PureFM Technical Documentation!

Here you will find all the deets on how to use both studios, the big OB kit and the lil OB bag too... eventually. There will also be docs on how our network and infrastructure is configured - just no passwords or sensitive information :)

If you've stumbled across this and are looking for PureFM's public facing website the head over to [thisispurefm.com](https://thisispurefm.com)

For any further questions or to discuss technical training needs, please contact the Technical Director via [technicaldirector@thisispurefm.com](mailto:technicaldirector@thisispurefm.com).
