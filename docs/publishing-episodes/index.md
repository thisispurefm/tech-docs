# Publishing Episodes
We have the capabilities to publish recorded episodes to the internet. This could either be an online exclusive show or a live-to-air show whose recordings are recorded and published to the internet after being live.

All recorded episodes get published to a platform called [Acast](https://acast.com). This is a platform designed for podcasts however, we can also use it for radio shows. Acast gives us the option to automatically push the recorded episode to other platforms, including Spotify Podcasts. The best bit - Acast is free!

> We have moved to a new website provider and instructions for publishing episodes & shows on the website is no longer valid. The tech team are aware and can make changes in the mean time. 


## Getting Started
To get started, you will need:
1. The recorded episode which is ready to be published
2. Know which show it is a part of
3. Have the `episodeuploader` login to Acast.

{: .important}
If this is the first episode of a show which is being published, then you will need to create a show on both Acast and our website; you will then be able to publish the episode of that show.
