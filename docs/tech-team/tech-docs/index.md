# Tech Docs Docs

Yes, that's right. These tech docs are ✨so cool✨ that they have to have documentation of their own! Yea, we know how to have fun here in the PureFM Tech Team.

No, but in all seriousness - maintaining good documentation is a critical component of any Tech Team. Given the naturally high turnover rate of a Society Committee - ensuring the future generations know how and where to find things is critical. 

## Our Documentation Platform
We use [Just The Docs](https://just-the-docs.com), which is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages to power our documentation. This enables us to write Markdown which gets automatically converted to HTML, organised nicely then deployed to a GitHub pages site which we have put a custom domain on.

The GitHub repo which the documentation lives within, exists in the [/thisispurefm](https://github.com/thisispurefm) organisation. Anyone wanting access to it should speak to the Technical Director.
