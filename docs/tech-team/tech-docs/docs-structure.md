# Docs Structure

There isn't really anything too magical about the structure of this documentation other than the fact that we keep the Technical Team's documentation within `tech-team`. Other than that, categories are created where there might be more than one page (either now or in the future) for an item, or where it is a distinctively different topic that doesn't really fit with any other topics.
