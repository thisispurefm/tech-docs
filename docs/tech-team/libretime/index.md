# Libretime

Libretime is a secondary piece of Automation Software which is used because PlayIt Live cannot be trusted to work as we need it to.

## Accessing Libretime
Libretime can be accessed through it's web interface which is served on it's IP address. Login to this web interface using the admin credentials stored in the Password Vault. 

## Check It's Working
To confirm that Libretime is behaving, login to it's web interface and check that the *On Air* marker in the top right hand corner is red. If it isn't, wait a few moments and check again. If it isn't now - good luck.

## Known Issues
Libretime does not like to playout through the PC output of the "server" it's running on. Instead, access it as a Web MP3 Stream (as we do in PlayIt live for automated playout)

## Further documentation
None written here at this time - that's too much work for a temporary bodge. See Libretime's docs as they're alright.
