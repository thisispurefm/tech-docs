# Tech Team Info

Information for the tech team to do tech things

{: .warning}
Here be dragons! üî•üê≤

The tech team shared Google drive exists, and contains useful stuff such as paperwork, branding assets, useful diagrams,
 and custom audio projects (emergency tape & test audio).

Some of the more programming-esque stuff also exists on [Github](https://github.com/thisispurefm). This includes scripts
 running on the blackbox and icecast vps, these tech docs, the webplayer, tools page and custom radio clock. Some of
 these pages are hosted on Github Pages, as this is a completely free service and very easy to administrate.

For passwords and other more sensitive information, you will need to contact the technical director (If you are the new
 technical director, they should have already be transfered to you as part of the handover process).
