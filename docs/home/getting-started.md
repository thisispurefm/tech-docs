# Getting Started With Tech @ PureFM

Welcome to PureFM!

As you'd probably imagine, we've got quite a lot of technology setup to power our two studios and two OB kits. Quite a lot of this lives within our space in the Students Union building but some of it lives in *the cloud*.

This website will take you through how to use the relevant bits of technology to your involvement at Pure & in some cases how to fix it when it breaks (which we all hope will never happen!!). 

First, however, everyone will need to follow the subsequent steps to get started using tech @ PureFM.

## What **you** need to do to get started with Tech at PureFM
1. Be an Affiliate Member. You can sign up on our upsu.net page.
2. Complete the Account Creation Request form: [forms.gle/a3df2XiUiGnYCDbd9](https://forms.gle/a3df2XiUiGnYCDbd9)

And that's it, yes it is really that simple.

Once you've completed the Account Creation Request form, the Technical Director will review your request and create your account. You will then get an email giving you your username and a temporary password which you will need to change when you login for the first time.

## What do I get access to?
For now - just our Windows Computers. In the future, we will be giving out access to PlayIt Live (our Automation Software) however, for now this hasn't been setup. 

Through the Windows computers, you'll also get access to our internal file storage system. The access to this will be changing in the future and we'll be sure to update this documentation when that does change!
