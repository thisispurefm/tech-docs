# Studio 1 Quick Help:

### The microphone fader is up, but I cannot hear any speech?

Check that the button below the microphone fader is lit, It should show as green if the fader is up.

### The guests can hear buzzing through their headphones?

Buzzing may be heard through the guest headphones due to a grounding fault. We are currently trying to solve this but
 this will not affect the live output.

### I cannot hear any sound through the monitor speakers?

Check to see that the plug labelled 'Mon Speakers Amp' is turned on, this is located on the left row of sockets. If
 this is powered on, check that all microphone faders are pulled down and the button below them are showing red. Check
 that the silver volume dial on the right mixer is up to around 20%.

### Can I hear/download live recordings?

No, it is in the works :)

### The Playout Computer has crashed! What do I do?

Although it is uncommon, Play-it can sometimes crash. It will usually continue the playout of a song. If possible, use
 a link to cover the time it takes to reboot the software (this will usually take less than a minute) and it should
 recover to the point where it crashed! If it is taking too long, you can use the `ETAPE` slider to play an emergency
 track. If you need to restart the computer, you will need to ask for the `s1automation` password from the supervising
 committee member.
