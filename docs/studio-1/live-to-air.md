# Running Studio 1
This guide will take you through how to operate Studio 1 for a Live-To-Air broadcast.

## You Will Need
- A committee member to allow you access to the studio
- Your Playlist, ready to import to the system

## Part 1: Entering the Studio and Setting Up
1. When you arrive at the studio, do not enter until the Committee member allows you to do so; this is to ensure that the studio is clear for entry
2. Once you've entered the studio, sign in using the sign in sheet then switch on the "Mic Live" light - this light switch is below the normal light switch
3. If you feel so inclined - turn on the aesthetic lighting, using the plugs labelled as so. 
4. Turn on the green labelled plug behind the presenter's chair. This will turn on the audio monitors.
5. Turn on the the green labelled plug to the left of the presenter's position - this will turn on the visual monitors
6. Login to the `PURE-S1-02` with *your* PureFM Credentials
7. Login to PlayIt Live using *your* PlayIt Live credentials. If the PC requires a password - speak to your supervising Committee members. 

## Part 2: Setting Up PlayIt For Your Show
1. On the *Quick Cart Wall* (on the right hand monitor), cycle through the pages using the arrows in the top left corner until you find yours. This will take a moment to load, then it should show you Quick Carts. [PHOTO]
2. Scroll on the Playout Log to find your show's hour. This should be directly below where it is currently.
3. Look at the Special Items Palette [PHOTO]
4. Click and drag a `Fixed Time Marker` to your show's hour. This will need to be at the Top of The Hour to ensure that and automated blocks playing out before your show - don't run over too much. (COMMITTEE TO DECIDE TO USE HARD OR SOFT. ADD THAT HERE THEN ADD SCREENSHOT)
5. Using the Track search options, find the first song in your show. Drag into the playout log, drop it **below** the fixed time marker.
6. If you have time - keep adding more tracks to your show. If you don't, start your show then add more tracks while the first one is playing.

## Part 3: Using the Studio
Our Sound Desk is split into two parts, this is the heart of the studio and most of the documentation will focus on this.

* how faders work, duck if talking over something
* The buttons below the faders
* Maybe something about what EQ is and trim and pan etc
* Don't press the CUE PFL button (shouldn't be illuminated)
* monitors cut out when mic open. headphones still work. 
### Left Sound Desk
The channels highlighted below are the three microphone channels. They are standard channel strips. You should be able to leave the EQs neutral and it sounds okay.

### Right Sound Desk
The channel highlighted in blue below is the master output for Playit Live. The channel highlighted in red below is the Emergency Tape. The EQs for all channels on the right hand side of the desk should be able to be left neutral, apart from the *Trim* for the Emergency Tape which needs to be turn up to the max.  

#### Monitor Outputs
The four knobs below are used for monitor outputs. The top left (highlighted in blue) is for the guest headphones amplifier; the top right (highlighted in red) is the monitor speakers in the studio; and the bottom right (highlighted in yellow) is the presenter headphones.

None of these knobs should need to be turned up more than to 9 O'Clock.
