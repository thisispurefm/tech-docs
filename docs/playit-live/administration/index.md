# PlayIt Live Administration

PlayIt Live Administration is only to be conducted by trained members. You will require an account with elevated permission to complete most of the tasks - these can be obtained from the Technical Director, who is the technical owner of the software. The Business Owner (and therefore the person responsible for the configuration of it, beyond installing and managing accounts) - is the Head of Music.
