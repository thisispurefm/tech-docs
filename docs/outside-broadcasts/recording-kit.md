# Recording Kit

The PureFM Recording Kit is an all-in-one solution for recording single-person and small group interviews. The kit is available to borrow with authorisation from a Committee member and can be taken to events. There is a full kit list provided below and should any issues with the kit arise - please complete a [Tech Support Request](https://thisispurefm.com/tsr).

## Equipment
The Recording Kit is comprised of:
1. Zoom H4N Pro Digital Audio Recorder
   1. 64GB SD Card
   2. 2 sets of 2 x AA batteries
   3. Zoom H4N Charger? maybe
   4. Wind Muff (attached to recorder, do not remove)
   5. Mini USB B to USB A cable
   6. Micro-Tripod
   7. Handle
2. Carry bag

## Configurations of the Recorder
### Standalone Handheld Recorder
In most circumstances, this kit will be used as-is, without any additional microphones or configuration.
### External Device Recorder
The Zoom H4N also supports external devices being connected to it. This enables microphones (or other audio devices) to be connected to it. If you require this service, the Technical Director must sign off on the rental of the equipment.
### Audio Interface
The Zoom H4N is also able to be used as an Audio Interface, thus enabling the output from it to be piped into a laptop which can either be recorded through the laptop / streamed back to the studio as part of a live OB. This service requires consultation with the Technical Director due to the complex nature of an OB. 

## Using The Recorder As A Recorder 
- Turn on the Zoom H4n Pro using the power switch. This is located on the left hand side of the unit, near the bottom. To operate the power switch - pull down in the direction of the power icon.

{: .important  }
The Zoom H4n Pro is slow to turn on. Wait for the screen to no longer display a sand timer before progressing.

- Once the Zoom H4n Pro has turned on, the screen will now display a timer and empty audio level monitoring bars. 
- Before you do anything else - you will need to ensure that the correct microphone input is selected. To do this, use the small black buttons on the left hand side of the front panel of the Zoom H4n Pro. To use the in-built microphones, press the Mic button. A small red light will illuminate to indicate that this has been selected.
- On the front of the device, press the red recording button once to enable *silent monitoring*. This will enable the on-screen monitoring without beginning the recording. The ring-light around the recording button will flash red to indicate that the Zoom H4n Pro is in Silent Monitor mode. 
- Now, position the Zoom H4n Pro in the desired location for recording. It should be placed so all parties talking into it are approximately 30cm away from the microphones (which will normally be covered by the muff).
- Using the on-screen silent monitoring, ensure that the levels are not peaking or passing -6.
- When you are ready to record, press the record button again. The light will turn solid red and the device will begin to record. You will also note that the counter at the top of the screen will begin to count up, displaying the duration of your recording. Furthermore, make a note (either mental or physical) of the file name displayed directly below the recording length duration as this will be important in a moment. 
- When you have finished recording, press the Stop button on the front of the Zoom H4n Pro. This will end the recording and ensure that it is saved correctly. A sand timer will be displayed on the Zoom H4n Pro's screen while this operation is taking place, please be patient as this may take some time depending on the length of the recording.

## Retrieving Content From the Zoom H4n Pro on PC
- First, connect the Mini USB B to USB A cable to the port on the left hand side of the Zoom H4n Pro.
- Press the menu button on the right hand side of the Zoom H4n Pro and using the directional wheel located above the Menu button, scroll down to `USB`. Select `USB` by pressing the directional wheel in. 
- Then, ensuring that `Storage` is highlighted, press the directional wheel in again to select it. This will connect the Zoom H4n Pro to the computer which it has been plugged into.
- Using the file explorer of your choice, extricate the files from the Zoom H4n Pro and save them somewhere secure. 
- When you are ready to disconnect the Zoom H4n Pro from your computer, press the Menu button on the right hand side of the unit to disconnect it. DO NOT JUST UNPLUG IT!
- This may take a few minutes to disconnect, then you may unplug the USB cable. 

## Operating the Zoom H4n Pro in Alternate Modes
No documentation is provided for this, yet. When the need arises - documentation will be produced.

## Technical Notes
This section contains instructions which the Tech Team only will need.  
If you are not a member of the tech team, do not perform any of the tasks listed below.
### Formatting the SD Card
For some unknown reason, the SD Card must be formatted in a slightly strange way. To do this, insert the SD card directly to a computer and use the disk partition tool to:
1. Clear all existing partitions on the SD Card
2. Add all sectors, excluding the first, to a partition and format this using Fat32. 
3. Do not include the first sector in any partitions.
When you return the SD Card to the Zoom H4n Pro, decline it's offer to format the card for you.
