# Recording Kit

The PureFM Recording Kit is an all-in-one solution for recording single-person and small group interviews. The kit is available to borrow with authorisation from a Committee member and can be taken to events. There is a full kit list provided below and should any issues with the kit arise - please complete a [Tech Support Request](https://thisispurefm.com/tsr).

## Equipment
The Recording Kit is comprised of:
1. Zoom H4N Pro Digital Audio Recorder
   1. 64GB SD Card
   2. 2 sets of 2 x AA batteries
   3. Zoom H4N Charger? maybe
   4. Wind Muff (attached to recorder, do not remove)
   5. Mini USB B to USB A cable
2. Carry bag

## Configurations of the Recorder
### Standalone Handheld Recorder
In most circumstances, this kit will be used as-is, without any additional microphones or configuration.
### External Device Recorder
The Zoom H4N also supports external devices being connected to it. This enables microphones (or other audio devices) to be connected to it. If you require this service, the Technical Director must sign off on the rental of the equipment.
### Audio Interface
The Zoom H4N is also able to be used as an Audio Interface, thus enabling the output from it to be piped into a laptop which can either be recorded through the laptop / streamed back to the studio as part of a live OB. This service requires consultation with the Technical Director due to the complex nature of an OB. 

## Using The Recorder As A Recorder 
- Turn on the Zoom H4n Pro using the power switch. This is located on the left hand side of the unit, near the bottom. To operate the power switch - pull down in the direction of the power icon.

The Zoom H4n Pro is slow to turn on. Wait for the screen to no longer display a sand timer before progressing.
