# Outside Broadcasts

Outside Broadcasts (OBs) are critical to make radio (and the tech team's life) more interesting. We currently only have capacity for *Outside Recordings* and *Full-Host OBs*.

PureFM has two OB kits:
1. Large OB Kit: Suitable for Full-Host (and eventually Co-Host OBs)
2. Small Recording Kit (only to be used for recording)

Through consultation with the Technical Director - it may be possible to arrange a non-standard configuration of equipment if the event requires it. 

{: .warning}
Before beginning planning for any form of Outside Broadcast, the Technical Director must sign off on it. This is to ensure we are capable of running the broadcast.
