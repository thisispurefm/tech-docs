# Outside Broadcasts

Outside Broadcasts (OBs) are critical to make radio (and the tech team's life) more interesting. We have the capacity for two types of OB:
1. Full OB
2. Co-Host OB

{: .warning}
Before beginning planning for any form of Outside Broadcast, the Technical Director must sign off on it. This is to ensure we are capable of running the broadcast.
